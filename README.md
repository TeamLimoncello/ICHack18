# AirGestures

AirGestures is the new way to interact with your computer effortlessly,
without even needing to touch it.

It's perfect:

-   for elderly computer users with limited fine motor control.
-   when cooking, to scroll the recipe.
-   when lecturing, to keep chalk off their laptops.

In future it could be further expanded into areas such as driving, where drawing the eye away from the road to use digital instruments can be dangerous, so gestures would be perfect.

## Getting Started

Using AirGestures is as simple as installing the app on your Mac and
your iPhone, and then connecting them by USB cable. The app icon on Mac
will then turn from grey to black, to show it has connected. You can now
open a webpage, book or presentation, and then use gestures over your
phone to control it.

## Our technology

AirGestures makes use of Microsoft's [Custom Vision library] to identify
hand shapes and understand your gestures. These are then fed back to the
Mac with [Kiran Kunigiri's wrapper] for the [PeerTalk library].
